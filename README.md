# Frontend Village Election Voting System

## 📝 Description

This repository contains the frontend codebase for a web-based electronic voting system specifically designed for village head elections. The system is built using **Nuxt 3**, a powerful framework for building modern Vue.js applications.

The aim of this system is to ensure secure, efficient, and transparent voting processes tailored to local elections.

> **Note:** This project is the **frontend** counterpart of the **backend** repository: [village-election-voting-system-backend](https://github.com/bagusvalentinoo/village-election-voting-system-backend). Make sure to set up the backend system first before running the frontend.
